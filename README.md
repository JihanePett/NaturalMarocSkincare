**PROJECT'S NAME**

  **Natural Maroc Skincare**
Natural Maroc Skincare is an online shop focused mainly on selling Non-toxic, 
100% organic skincare based essentially on Argan oil.

This project is based on my knowledge of Argan oil and on the fact that 
I have created a range of products that I want to sell online.
Argan oil is deemed to be the **GOLDEN OIL**, its uniqueness, rarety (as only found in Morocco) combined by
its incredible properties makes it a must-sought after product.

**My main goal is to**
  
  * Empower women (as the collection of Argan oil are made only by Moroccan women), 
  * Raise awareness of these unique argan oil based products. 
     **  As a matter of fact, Argan oil has been overly used by the big companies, 
        as a promotional mean to sell more products, and often when you check these products' labels, 
        their Argan oil content reaches <1% of the overall ingredients.
  * Generate revenue

___The users' benefits are of health and beauty__
